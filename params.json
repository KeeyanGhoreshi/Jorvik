  "body": "### Introduction\r\nJorvik is a collection of apps which have been built using open source tools to illustrate using HL7 FHIR in the UK (England and Scotland) Hospitals. Most are cut down versions of operational systems with the odd example which is for evaluation purposes.\r\n\r\n### Patterns\r\n\r\nJorvik doesn't contain any examples of an open source Trust Integration Engine (TIE) (also known as Orchestration Engine [SDP:OrchestrationEngine(224)]). That may sound odd to those familiar with HL7 v2 messaging but we're find we use HL7 FHIR where HL7 had no (developer friendly) solution. I've been heavily influenced by Martin Fowlers Signature Series patterns of books and will refer to them frequently using similar pattern identification. They are:\r\n\r\n* Service Design Pattern [SDP]\r\n* Enterprise Integration Pattern [EIP]\r\n* Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture [PEAA]\r\n\r\nThe core patterns we've used is the Canonical Data Model [EIP:CanoncialDataModel(355)] (described on page 355 of Enterprise Integration Patterns). Our main data model is HL7 v2 and is used heavily by our TIE Engine for messaging between systems [SDP:MessageAPI(27)] and is used heavily for a number of [EIP] patterns (read the book!). \r\n\r\n\r\n",
