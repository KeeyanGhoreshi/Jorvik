  "body": "### Introduction\r\nJorvik is a collection of apps which have been built using open source tools to illustrate using HL7 FHIR in the UK (England and Scotland) Hospitals. Most are cut down versions of operational systems with the odd example which is for evaluation purposes.\r\n\r\n### Patterns\r\n\r\nJorvik doesn't contain any examples of an open source Trust Integration Engine (TIE) - also known as Orchestration Engine [SDP:OrchestrationEngine(224)]. That may sound odd to those familiar with HL7 v2 messaging but we're find we use HL7 FHIR where HL7 had no (developer friendly) solution. I've been heavily influenced by Martin Fowlers Signature Series patterns of books and will refer to them frequently using similar pattern identification. They are:\r\n\r\n* Service Design Pattern [SDP]\r\n* Enterprise Integration Pattern [EIP]\r\n* Patterns of Enterprise Application Architecture [PEAA]\r\n\r\nThe core patterns we've used is the Canonical Data Model [EIP:CanoncialDataModel(355)] (described on page 355 of Enterprise Integration Patterns). Our main data model continues to be HL7 v2 which is used heavily by our TIE Engine for messaging between systems [SDP:MessageAPI(27)] and behind a large number of our integration patterns [EIP]. \r\nIt works very well for sending information to remote systems but is not ideal for retrieving data. This is primarily where FHIR comes in, it can provide a simple RESTful interface to JSON/XML resource - it's ideal model for a Resource API [SDP:ResoureAPI(29)]. FHIR (mostly) converts nicely to v2 and vice versa, so our models used are:\r\n\r\n* HL7v2 for MessagingAPI(27)\r\n* HL7 FHIR for ResourceAPI(29)\r\n\r\nNote: Although we use HL7v3 within the trust these are for interfacing with national systems and it is not used internally.\r\n\r\n### Facades\r\n\r\nOur main uses for FHIR is building facades onto Message Gateways [EIP:MessagingGateway(468)] as a ResourceAPI. An example of this can be found here https://github.com/nhs-ciao/ciao-pds-fhir This hides the complexity of the SMSP interactions behind a simple FHIR Patient interface (note: this is an example and another example should hopefully come out of GP Connect)\r\n\r\nOther facades include RemoteFacade [PEAA:RemoteFacade(388)] which we used to reduce network access and load on our TIE engine. This was done by moving out part of the processing (interactions with EDMS servers) to a application server (Apache Tomcat) which provided a FHIR ResourceAPI to our EDMS. This was used by the TIE **and Web Developers**\r\nBoth the **HL7v2-HAPI** and **UKFHIR-HAPI** provide examples of this pattern, in both cases the feeds originate from the TIE one HL7v2 and the other a document bundle which are used to populate a HAPI FHIR Server.\r\n\r\n",
